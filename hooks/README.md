# Hooks

Claude Code hooks are scripts that run at specific points during tool execution. Copy this directory to `~/.claude/hooks/`, then add the configuration snippets below to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## git-push-guard.sh

Requires explicit confirmation before any `git push` command executes. Prevents accidental pushes when Claude is running autonomously.

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/git-push-guard.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Merge the `hooks` object into your existing settings.json. If you already have `PreToolUse` hooks, add the new hook object to the existing array.
